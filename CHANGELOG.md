# Changelog

All notable changes to the API and the widget are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Feedback page redesign: screenshot first with the sender's message as a sticky, hideable card; technical details on a second tab with copy buttons for every value and log entry and "Copy report" as plain text; console errors highlighted and counted on the tab.
- Feedback pages behind signed, expiring links with all details, console and network log and the screenshot (inline and download).
- `feedback:link {id}` creates team links that can complete and reopen the entry (`--by` is logged, `--read-only`, `--expires`).
- The API returns a read-only share link after sending (`FEEDBACK_SHARE_LINK_MINUTES`, `0` turns it off); the widget shows it on the thank you screen with a copy button, `after_send` receives it as `url`.
- Close button in marking mode (top right, bottom right on phones), same as Esc.

### Changed

- The widget is no longer published to npm: the API serves it at `/widget/v1/feedback.js` (one script tag, no npm, no CDN, updated with every deploy). `npm run build` compiles it into `resources/widget/v1`. The npm package `@codebar-ag/feedback-widget` 1.0.0 stays available but gets no updates. Removed: release workflow, type definitions, SRI file, publint and attw.
- The widget only appears on pages the API accepts: it checks the project config first and stays hidden on a `403` (origin or IP not allowed). Refused `GET` requests now carry `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` so the widget can read the `403`; the preflight for sending stays refused.
- Dev dependencies: vite 8.3.5, typescript-eslint 8.72.0.

### Fixed

- Feedback links answered 403 in browsers behind a TLS terminating proxy (Laravel Cloud): the navigation guard checked the signature against the http:// URL before the trusted proxies were applied. The route's signature check stays authoritative.
- `<noscript>` content (e.g. of an Alpine toast region) showed up as literal markup in screenshots; `<noscript>` and `<template>` are now left out.
- Screenshots with the script tag from the API: the lazy screenshot chunk was served without `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, so other websites could not load it.
- Screenshots of pages using Alpine, Vue or other framework attributes (`:class`, `x-on:click`) were blank.
